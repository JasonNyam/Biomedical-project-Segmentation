# Biomedical-project-Segmentation
Here is a Deep learning project in python I did with a classmate

Project goals:

Understand the variability of the data in a database of medical images 

Produce a visual representation of the geometric variability

Produce a visual representation of the intensity variability

Build a network model and train it on the chosen basis

Define a choice of separation between training base and test base

Work with Unet architecture + training

The code is not complete but most of the work is there.

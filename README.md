# Biomedical-project-Segmentation
Here is a Deep learning project in python I did with a classmate

Project goals:

To understand the variability of the data in a database of medical images 

To produce a visual representation of the geometric variability 

To produce a visual representation of the intensity variability

To Build a network model and train it on the chosen basis

To Define a choice of separation between training base and test base

To work with Unet architecture + training


The code is not complete but most of the work is there.
